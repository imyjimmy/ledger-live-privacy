# REKT's Lecce Libre Fork

A Ledger Live version without user tracking 

Aiming for fully anonymous operation 

## Project Goals

* Allow fully anonymous ledger HW setup and updates

* Be lightweight, no images, no animations, no bloat

* Be private. Contact the network as little as possible

* To work offline / airgapped, allowing secure setups

## Running Lecce Libre

Currently, there's no binary release of Lecce Libre

To run, you need the basics of Nodejs / Typescript 

First, follow the original build instructions [from here](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live)

Then do this on the repo root:

`./rundev.sh`

Make sure you're running Node version >= 16

Something like this would do:

`nvm use 16.20.2`
